# Weather app

A Proof of Concept (POC) app that utilizes OpenMeteo API to show latest weather conditions and historical data charts.

It's a project created as part of university assignment and as such I cut the corners quite a bit here and there. Please keep that in mind.

## Tech stack

React Native, OpenMeteo, chart.js

## Run it

```
yarn install
yarn run web
```

This app was only tested on web.
